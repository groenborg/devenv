# Development Environment 

This is a project meant to make tablets usefull for work, which will be practical during journeys where laptops might be difficult to work with.
The point is to spin up a docker container, or clone this project to any Virtual Machine, which then will provide a preconfigured setup for developing
in a ssh session. 

## Goal
The `devenv` is still far from done, but the goal is to: 

- Easily setup a comfortable environment on any VM
- Provide a docker image for multiple environments on the same VM
- Support development for: **Angular 5**, **Nodejs**, **Golang**
- Provide a full set of **git** tools
- Work with **kubernetes**
